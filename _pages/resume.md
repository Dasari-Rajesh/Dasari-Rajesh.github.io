## Technical Skills 

<strong>Programming</strong> :   C++, Python, Bash, Java ,VHDL

<strong>Web Development</strong>  : Django , HTML , JavaScript, Flask

<strong>Data Analysis</strong>  :  MATLAB, Matplotlib ,NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, SQlite.
 
<strong>Software</strong>  : Git, LATEX, AutoCad, SolidWorks , Quartus.

## Key Projects

<strong>Notify Me</strong>

Instructor : Prof. Amitabha Sanyal | Ongoing Course Project  |   Autumn 2020  IIT Bombay

• Worked on an application to create a Centralized Notification System whereby a professor can send
real-time notifications to the students enrolled utilsing the application

• Built a Dashboard, similar to moodle/Teams, using Django where a Professor can view the list of recipients
who acknowledged a notification and can set deadlines for an event

• Designed a corresponding Android Application using Android Studio to resemble a virtual classroom
environment(Google Classroom) which is much needed in this coronavirus crisis

<strong> GIF(Graphics Interchange Format)</strong>

Instructor : Prof. Rushikesh K.Joshi | Course Project |   Spring 2020  IIT Bombay

• Implemented a C++ class for creation and efficient way of portraying animations using Fltk (Fast Light
ToolKit), a cross-platform widget library for Graphical User Interfaces

• Used simple Widgets provided by Fltk for implementation of a class named gif to represent Simple Harmonic
Motion of a ball constrained to move in a straight line

• Extended this idea to create a gif with 8 balls arranged in a beautiful manner, so that they apparently move
in a circle with proper contrast between the surroundings and the components.

• Implemented various beautiful designs using the tools provided by Fltk as a part of this project

<strong>Image Segmentation</strong> 
Instructor : Prof. Amitabha Sanyal | Course Project  | Autumn 2020  IIT Bombay

• Used Kmeans++ algorithm and python Scipy Library to smoothen high contrast images.

• Utilized NumPy, Pandas, SciPy libraries of Python to store pixels of images in matrix form.

• Using K-means algorithm to find centroid and replaced all pixels by it’s centroid for image segmentation.

<strong>Levitt’s Matric</strong>

Instructor : Prof. Amitabha Sanyal | Course Project  |  Autumn 2020  IIT Bombay

• Used requests module of python to fetch India’s COVID-19 CSV files from a link.

• Utilized python csv, pandas and Matplotlib modu;e for plotting scattered graph of COVID-19 data.

• Used this plot to find the approximate number of days by which pandemic gets to end.

## Extracurricular Activities

• Completeed one year rigorous physical training in 2 Maharastra Engineering Regiment National Cadet
Corps at IIT Bombay     (2019-2020)


• Attended Annual Training Camp of 10 days and underwent rigorous and professional military training.

• Fired 5 rounds of 0.22 Sporting Rifle with great precision in Annual training Camp of NCC.

• Assembled and Disassembled Self Loading Rifle (earlier used by Indian Army) as a part of NCC training.

• Volunteered as a mentor for Career Counselling Campaign to guide high school children of Government
Schools acroos Mumbai conducted by Abhyuday,IIt Bombay in collaboration with NCC.
(2019)

• Participated in RC Plane Competition a remote controlled plane making competition organised by the
Aeromodellers Club IITB.The plane had a form body with servo motors for wing control.
(2019)

<strong>Permutations</strong>

Instructor : Prof. Ajit A. Diwan | Course Project | Autumn 2020 IIT Bombay

• Implemented a C++ class for creation and efficient manipulation of permutation objects

• Implemented the operations of inverse and composition

• Utilised concepts from Group theory in acheiving linear time for implementation of above mentioned

<strong>operations.Decoding Monoalphabetic Substitution</strong>

Instructor : Prof. Amitabha Sanyal | Course Project | Autumn 2020 IIT Bombay

• Developed a decoding scheme for text encoded according to a monoalphabetic substitution based on a secret
word key in Racket language by implementing the freaquency based ETAI strategy and used to crack a cipher.

• Applied Dictionary Closure and Secret Word Enumeration Strategies to decrypt the ciphertext.
